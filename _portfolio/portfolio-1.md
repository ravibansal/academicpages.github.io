title: "Visual-content based Video Retrieval on Natural Language Query"
excerpt: "Used encoderdecoder model with LSTM units to encode the temporal sequence of frames and generated a fixed length caption for every video. Captions are embedded using skip-thoughts vector for query time. Pre-trained image recognition model was used to extract features from frames.<br/><img src='/images/500x300.png'>"
